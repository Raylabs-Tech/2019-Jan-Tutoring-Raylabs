## Function definition
```
def f(a,b,c):
 statement_1
 statement_2
 ..
 return(v)
 ..
```

Function name, arguments/parameters

Body is indented

return() statement exits and returns a value

Passing values to functions

Argument value is substituted for name
```
def power(x,n):
 ans = 1
 for i in range(0,n):
 ans = ans*x
 return(ans)
```

Like an implicit assignment statement

power(3,5)
x = 3
n = 5
ans = 1

for i in range..

Passing values â€¦

Same rules apply for mutable, immutable values

Immutable value will not be affected at calling
point

Mutable values will be affected

## Example
```
def update(l,i,v):
 if i >= 0 and i < len(l):
 l[i] = v
 return(True)
 else:
 v = v+1
 return(False)
ns = [3,11,12]
z = 8
```

update(ns,2,z)
update(ns,4,z)
ns is [3,11,8]
z remains 8

Return value may be ignored

If there is no return(), function ends when last
statement is reached
---

## Scope of names

Names within a function have local scope
```
def stupid(x):
 n = 17
 return(x)
n = 7
v = stupid(28)
# What is n now? n is still 7
```

Name n inside function is separate from n outside

## Defining functions
A function must be defined before it is invoked

This is OK
```
def f(x):
 return(g(x+1))
def g(y):
 return(y+3)
z = f(77)
```

This is not
```
def f(x):
 return(g(x+1))
z = f(77)
def g(y):
 return(y+3)
 ```
 
## Recursive functions
A function can call itself â€” recursion
```
def factorial(n):
 if n <= 0:
 return(1)
 else:
 val = n * factorial(n-1)
 return(val)
``` 
## for and while

Can use while to simulate for

However, use for where it is natural

Makes for more readable code

What makes a good program?

Correctness and efficiency â€” algorithm

Readability, ease of maintenance â€” style

What you say, and how you say it
