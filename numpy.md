NumPy is a Python package. It stands for 'Numerical Python'. 
It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array.


**Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations âˆ’**
Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.
Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.


NumPy supports a much greater variety of numerical types than Python does. The following table shows different scalar data types defined in NumPy.
Sr.No.	Data Types & Description
1	
bool_

Boolean (True or False) stored as a byte

2	
int_

Default integer type (same as C long; normally either int64 or int32)

3	
intc

Identical to C int (normally int32 or int64)

4	
intp

Integer used for indexing (same as C ssize_t; normally either int32 or int64)

5	
int8

Byte (-128 to 127)

6	
int16

Integer (-32768 to 32767)

7	
int32

Integer (-2147483648 to 2147483647)

8	
int64

Integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

9	
uint8

Unsigned integer (0 to 255)

10	
uint16

Unsigned integer (0 to 65535)

11	
uint32

Unsigned integer (0 to 4294967295)

12	
uint64

Unsigned integer (0 to 18446744073709551615)

13	
float_

Shorthand for float64

14	
float16

Half precision float: sign bit, 5 bits exponent, 10 bits mantissa

15	
float32

Single precision float: sign bit, 8 bits exponent, 23 bits mantissa

16	
float64

Double precision float: sign bit, 11 bits exponent, 52 bits mantissa

17	
complex_

Shorthand for complex128

18	
complex64

Complex number, represented by two 32-bit floats (real and imaginary components)

19	
complex128

Complex number, represented by two 64-bit floats (real and imaginary components)

NumPy numerical types are instances of dtype (data-type) objects, each having unique characteristics. 
The dtypes are available as np.bool_, np.float32, etc.
